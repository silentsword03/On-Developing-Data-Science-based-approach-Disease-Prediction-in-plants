Different individual models for cassava (Surtono and Ratu Ayu, 2021), rice leaf (N, E, and Bharat, 2021), cotton (Yang Li, 2021), etc., are identified which are developed to predict if the specimen is diseased or healthy. So far, no generic model has been developed for identifying disease-affected plants for multiple species. In this study, we would like to explore and implement ensemble methods to improve results for the generic model and work to achieve higher accuracy to predict the disease-affected plant species (17 species). Our main objective would be to build a predictive disease solution for different plant species by implementing a single model to help the agriculture industry. However, the scope of the study is confined to only the species mentioned above.
